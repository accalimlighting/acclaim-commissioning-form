Place Suisse International webfont files here (add to repo if licensed or keep local):

- SuisseIntl-Regular.woff2 / .woff
- SuisseIntl-Medium.woff2 / .woff
- SuisseIntl-SemiBold.woff2 / .woff

The CSS in `app/globals.css` already references these names at `/fonts/...`. If you cannot commit the font files, keep them locally or set them as assets in your hosting platform.***
